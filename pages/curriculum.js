          SaMTEC developed skills and professional-based curriculum and teaching
          guides fit for Global Occupational Standards.
        </p>
        <p className='fw-bold'>
          The curriculum and teaching guides reflect skills and attitudes
          necessary for propelling the nation to a globally competitive country
          and hence the paradigm shift to embrace competency-based education and
          training in Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          This entailed consultation with the industry and trainers from
          different sectors who were then brought on board to develop the SaMTEC
          curriculum and teaching guides.
        </p>
        <p className='fw-bold'>
          Each course curriculum and each teaching guide comprise three levels
          (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3), and each level is a combination of
          six months of institutional training and supervised three months of
          industrial attachment training, hence complete course duration is 27
          months (18 months of institutional training and 9 months of industrial
          attachment training).
