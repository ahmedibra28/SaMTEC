          There are two pathways into a diploma course; a direct entry and an
          entry through a certificate program. A direct entry into a diploma
          course is for those students who have a qualifying grade from a
          secondary school or post secondary school education (such as a
          diploma, certificate or degree). A certificate pathway is also
          available for students who have a recognized certificate. Please
          contact the college registrar for more information.
