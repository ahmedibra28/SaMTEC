   Shamsa Adan is a 14-year-old girl from Luuq primary school. She is the third born in a family of seven household members. She resides in Akaro area near Luuq center. She has been studying in the school for the last six years and she is planning to finish her studies at the same if all goes to plan.

"I am very grateful for this school and all those who are helping it so that we can achieve our goals. These include our parents, our teachers, and the government and most important the Non-governmental organizations that are ensuring every one of us is getting good knowledge to help our people in the future. I have big plans and when I finish my primary school level education, I would like to join the nearby secondary school and up to the university.

I would like to be a doctor to help my people because doctors in this region are few and most of the people are in dire need of a good health system.  I would also like to urge the young people who are traveling to western countries passing through dangerous and hardship routes to look for better lives through education since our country is in need of different professionals such as engineers, teachers, lawyers, doctors, accountants among others.

My parents have been very supportive in ensuring I get everything that I need and through community mobilization by the N.G.Os they have come to understand the importance of Education especially to the girl child".`,
